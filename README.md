# Unreal Engine Project

Welcome to my Unreal Engine project! This project represents my first venture into the exciting world of game development using Unreal Engine. As part of my coursework, I embarked on this journey to learn and apply fundamental game development concepts and techniques.

## Project Overview

This project is a product of my learning process and is not intended as a fully polished or complete game. It serves as a testament to my dedication to expanding my skills and knowledge in game development. As a result, please be aware that there are several areas in the project that may have shortcomings, bugs, or incomplete features.

## Project Goals

- **Learning Unreal Engine:** The primary goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with Unreal Engine. I used this opportunity to explore various aspects of game development, including level design, blueprint scripting, and asset integration.

- **Coursework Requirement:** This project was developed as part of my coursework, and its completion was necessary to fulfill academic requirements. While it may not be a fully realized commercial game, it represents a significant milestone in my journey as a game developer.
